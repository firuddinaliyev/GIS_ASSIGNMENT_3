Hello, dear Marta, we uploaded all files on GitHub except our data, because our data is bigger for GitHub size limit. So, we are adding a Google Drive link below, you can open link and download the zipped data folder easily,
please go to this link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GVQgm3bt_vBPK0izldHUJtfhirop7iYZ?usp=sharing
Please click on this link or copy and paste on you browser. This link includes all files again, but if you download other files on GitHub, you just need to dowload only data zipped file on Google Drive Link.
Best Regards,
Elphas, Firuddin, Paul
